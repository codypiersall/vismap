Vismap
======

Provides a Canvas for creating maps with Vispy.  The canvas gets its tiles from
a [TileProvider](vismap/tile_providers.py).  Several tile providers are
bundled with this project; adding a tile provider simply requires knowing the
 URL at which to grab a tile, and providing the attribution text for the tiles.

Example:
